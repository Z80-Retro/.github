# Welcome to the Z80 Retro! project repository collection!

The purpose of this organization is to provide an easy way to locate the repositories of hardware and software projects for the Z80 Retro!

Those projects that have been created by John Winans are discussed on the John's Basement channel on YouTube.  A Z80 Retro! playlist contains much detail about all aspects of this project including the circuit boards, CP/M, the BIOS, and a video display board that uses a popular Video Display Processor called the TMS9118.

The hardware project repos are:
- [2063-Z80](https://github.com/Z80-Retro/2063-Z80) - The Z80 CPU board
- [2065-Z80-programmer](https://github.com/Z80-Retro/2065-Z80-programmer) - a Raspberry PI based board that can program the Z80 Retro FLASH in-circuit.
- [2068-Z80-TMS9118](https://github.com/Z80-Retro/2068-Z80-TMS9118) - A Video Display Processor board with composite video output.
